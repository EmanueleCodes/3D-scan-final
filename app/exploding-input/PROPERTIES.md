Exploding Input - Property Controls

Preview
Shows or hides the particle animation while editing in Framer. Turn it off when you're positioning the component to save performance.

Mode
Choose between Components mode (uses component instances as particles) or Images mode (uses uploaded images as particles).

Content
Add component instances that will be used as particles when text is entered into the input field. Only visible in Components mode.

Count
Sets how many images to cycle through when using Images mode. Images 1-10 will appear based on this count. Only visible in Images mode.

Image 1-10
Upload images to use as particles. Each image will be randomly selected when particles spawn. Images appear based on the Count setting. Only visible in Images mode.

Width
Controls the width of particle images in pixels. Only visible in Images mode.

Height
Controls the height of particle images in pixels. Only visible in Images mode.

Amount
Sets how many particles spawn each time text is entered. Higher values create more particles at once.

Scale
Controls the base size of particles. Values below 1 make particles smaller, values above 1 make them larger.

Randomize
When enabled, adds random variation to particle scale. Each particle will be slightly different in size.

Variation
Sets how much the scale can vary from the base value, as a percentage. Only visible when Randomize is enabled. Higher values create more size variation between particles.

Rotation
Sets the initial rotation angle of particles in degrees. Positive values rotate clockwise, negative values rotate counterclockwise.

Animate
When enabled, particles will rotate continuously during their animation. The rotation will be randomized for each particle.

Direction
Controls which direction particles fly when they spawn. Horizontal controls left/right movement, Vertical controls up/down movement. Center options result in no movement in that axis.

Gravity
Controls how strongly particles are pulled down (positive values) or up (negative values). At 0, particles move in a straight line. Higher absolute values create stronger gravitational pull.

Duration
Sets how long particles remain visible before fading out, in seconds. Longer durations allow particles to travel further before disappearing.
